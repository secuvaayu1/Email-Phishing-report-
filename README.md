Phishing: The pizza you never ordered, but somehow you‚Äôre paying for."


Phishing in Real Life (Funny Perspective)

Think of it like this:
Someone dresses up in a fake pizza delivery uniform, knocks on your door, and says,
‚ÄúSir, your pizza subscription is about to expire in 24 hours‚Ä¶ unless you give me your credit card right now!‚Äù
You panic because‚Ä¶ wait‚Ä¶ pizza subscription?! üçï

That‚Äôs exactly what phishing emails do:

They pretend to be someone important (PayPal, your bank, or even Netflix).

They throw in a fake emergency (‚Äúaccount suspension‚Äù, ‚Äúfinal warning‚Äù) so you react fast without thinking.

They give you a dodgy link that looks legit but actually takes you to their secret scam lair.

In real life, people fall for it because the design, logo, and language look official ‚Äî but it‚Äôs basically a cyber version of a street con artist.


  Note:-
  "Verify the source before responding to any email request."

  Example how phishing mail will be delivered:

  Sample Email (Simulated via Emkei‚Äôs Fake Mailer)

From Name: PayPal Security Team

From Email: security@paypall.com (spoofed)
